# FDMR_Monitor_2_ver.-OA4DOA
The NEW default dashboard of FreeDMR

Christian, OA4DOA has very kindly customised HBMonitor for FreeDMR. This is now the default dashboard we install with FreeDMR. If, however, you have a need to set this up manually with docker, please replace any existing dasboard definitions with the below code in your docker-compose.yml file.
